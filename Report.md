Because of pythonâ€™s global interpreter lock, threads cannot run
concurrently. Since there is not much overhead in I/O operations in the
serial program, risk\_thr.py runs as fast as risk\_serial.py. However,
risk\_mp.py uses multiple processes that run in parallel and hence
outperforms risk\_serial.py and risk\_thr.py.
